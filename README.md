### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Andrius and currently:
  â€¢ I am learning Python, Git, Google Cloud, Cyber Security
  â€¢ I am interested in reading/watching all kind of courses, which will help me moving forward with both carrer and self improving
  â€¢ I am mainly playing Path of Exile, League of Legends and couple other games

Ain't that much happening now, but hopefully I will have some achievement to share here soon!
